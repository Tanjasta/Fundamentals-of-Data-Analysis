# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis

#### Introduction

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating data analysis and visualisation techniques in Python. It is aimed at providing practical examples and insights into data handling and visualisation.

**Notebooks**

* 		tasks.ipynb: This notebook includes a series of tasks that showcase different data manipulation and analysis techniques.

* 		project.ipynb: This notebook focuses on the analysis of the Fisherâ€™s Iris dataset.

#### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x

* Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

#### Installing Dependencies

Before running the notebooks, ensure that you have the following Python libraries installed:

* NumPy for numerical computations.

* Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

* Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
